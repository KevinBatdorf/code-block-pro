Code highlighting powered by the VS Code engine. Performance focused. No bloat.

== Description ==

Show off your beautiful code, don't just display it! This block plugin provides you with a code editor that runs your code directly through the same rendering engine that is used by the popular VS Code editor. This block provides fast, native, code highlighting that renders perfectly in your favorite programming language using popular VS Code themes.

Beautiful syntax highlighting that makes sense.

To use, navigate to the default WordPress editor, and search for "Code Pro" or start typing "/code".

Visit [code-block-pro.com](https://code-block-pro.com) for a lifetime deal on the theme pack (this is a cosmetic-only upgrade).

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Font size is too small/big =

Look under the "Styling" tab and turn on "Clamp Values", which will compute the rem values relative to a 16px-24px base * the selected rem values. e.g. clamp(20px, 1.25rem, 30px).

= How to use in headless =

Themes are rendered inside the editor as you type or make changes, so the code block itself will work without CSS or JavaScript. However, the font loading, copy button, and line highlighting require a tiny bit of JavaScript to function. Additionally, line blur uses a tiny bit of CSS which you will need to load in yourself or implement your own. The code tokens and theme styles are inline though, so no need to manipulate the DOM.

== Screenshots ==

1. Choose from more than 25 themes.
2. Customize fonts, themes, and behavior.
3. Disable padding and inline the code for a fluent experience.
4. Use highlighting and blur to focus on parts of the code.
5. ANSI support for rendering control sequences
